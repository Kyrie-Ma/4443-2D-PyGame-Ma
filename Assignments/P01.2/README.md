## P01.2 - CovidZAR Camera View
### Yuankai Ma
### Description:

What is a camera view?
Typically the camera makes you feel like you are in the center of the screen (the shaded portion around the middle is not seen by the player).
When in actuality the window (camera view) is moving all over the game "world" but only displaying a small portion at a time.
